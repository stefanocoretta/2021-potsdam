# Myths

- The voicing effect is a very common phenomenon.

- Polish and Czech do not show a voicing effect.

- The magnitude of the voicing effect in English is greater relative to that of other languages.

- The ratio of Vowel to Consonant duration is stable across speech rates.

Phonologisation is the creation of a new phonemic contrast, or in other words when a contextual allophone becomes *contrastive* (i.e. a phoneme).

A process is phonologised when it goes from being applied post-lexically to being applied lexically.

.pull-left[

Phonologisation occurs when the constraint ordering of the (post-lexical) phrasal domain is copied over onto the (lexical) word and stem domains.

Phonologisation occurs when a physio-anatomical ("mechanic") phenomenon comes under the control of the speaker/hearer and becomes part of their grammar (more specifically, part of the *phonetic module* of the grammar).

# Contextual effects (within-system)

- Greater effect in pre-pausal words.

- Greater effect in stressed vowels.

- Greater effect in word-final syllables.

- Greater effect in word-initial syllables along the hierarchy trisyllabic > disyllabic > monosyllabic.

- Greater effect in lower vowels.

--

They all have in common greater baseline vowel duration.

# Contextual effects (within-system)

Manner

- Stop vs fricative.

- Obstruent vs sonorant.

--

Mixed results.
